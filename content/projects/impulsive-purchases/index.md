i never really *intended* to buy a domain name.

## Too Afraid To Begin

i was honestly perfectly happy just using [afraid.org](https://freedns.afraid.org/) and using whatever subdomain i was given for any hosting i did. 

thing is.. i consider myself a power-user at heart, but i had never really had any worthwhile experience with anything on the software dev side of things. and when i say that, i mean i never really put out a project that i was proud of. 

yes i have dozens of forks of repos i like, and yes i "know" how to program. but what use is of that knowledge if i never apply it?

so when i was starting to reconfigure my router to open some ports for [xrMPE](https://www.moddb.com/mods/x-ray-multiplayer-extension), an idea sparked inside my brain. an impulsive idea? yes. of course it is, but i was actually going to apply my <cite>knowledge [^1]</cite> to this and try my best regardless.

## Domain Shenanigans

i honestly had no knowledge about domain registration. i genuinely had no idea where to even buy a domain in the first place. so as with any question you have on the internet, i asked google.

simply googling that questions led me down the rabbit hole of domain registrars and comparison websites that would leave me dizzy for days. 

one website i utilized to a great amount was [tld-list](https://tld-list.com/), as it gave me a wonderful breakdown of what registrars were offering.
